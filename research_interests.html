    <p> <b>Problem 1:</b> How is meaning represented when we are thinking -- with what are we reasoning? I would like to investigate into the primitives of mental logic or the language of thought. What about the meaning of questions? This is what I aim to look into with my project in the mental representation of wh-words supervised by <b>Prof. Matt Husband</b>. </p>

    <p> <b>Problem 2:</b> How do we express things when we don't say something, or choose not to say something? This is what I'm doing in my <b>Master's thesis</b>, where I aim to explain how temporal information is computed in Mandarin Chinese from discourse, where time can be left unspecified. I am also doing a project with <b>Prof. Brendan Gillon</b>, looking into the interpretations of <b>optional complements in Mandarin Chinese ditransitive verbs</b> when they are omitted. </p>

    <p>Honours thesis, McGill University (2023): On a Mandarin indefinite word <i>mǒu</i> (某) -- which is more or less odd with any further specification following it. I analyzed this effect as arising from a non-uniqueness presupposition. Supervised by Prof. Luis Alonso-Ovalle and Prof. Bernhard Schwarz. </p>
